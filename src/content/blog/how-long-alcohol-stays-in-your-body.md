The time alcohol remains in your system depends on several factors:

## Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) Breakdown:
- On average, the liver metabolizes about one standard drink per hour
- A standard drink is typically considered 14 grams of pure alcohol (e.g., 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, 1.5 oz spirits)

## Detection Time in Different Tests:
1. Breath Test
- Detectable for 12-24 hours after drinking
- Breathalyzer can detect alcohol immediately after consumption

2. Urine Test
- Detectable for 12-48 hours
- Advanced urine tests can detect alcohol metabolites up to 80 hours after drinking

3. Blood Test
- Detectable for 6-12 hours
- Most accurate for recent alcohol consumption

4. Hair Follicle Test
- Can detect alcohol use up to 90 days after consumption

You can use the [BAC Calculator](https://baccalculator.app) to calculate your BAC and see how long alcohol stays in your body.

## Factors Affecting Alcohol Metabolism:
- Body weight
- Gender
- Age
- Liver function
- Amount of alcohol consumed
- Food intake
- Hydration levels
- Metabolism rate

## Important Note:
These are general guidelines. Individual metabolism varies, and precise detection times can differ based on personal physiology and drinking patterns.
